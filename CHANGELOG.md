# Changelog

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE):

- Use only the approved words of the STE dictionary, with their approved meanings. You can also use technical names: Alder, Stremio, add-on, subtitle, and the names that Alder shows on the screen.
- Write one idea in each sentence. Write 20 words or fewer in an instruction and 25 words or fewer in a description.
- Use the active voice. Use the simple present tense, or the simple past tense for "Before, …".
- Do not use words that end in "-ing", except in technical names.
- Do not use contractions. Write "does not", not "doesn't". Text that Alder shows on the screen stays as it is.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Subtitles**", not "**Subtitles** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that Alder shows on the screen.
- Put each entry under one heading: `### New`, `### Easier to use` or `### Fixes`, in that order. In each group, put the most important entries first.
- Start an important entry with a short **bold** name. **See all changes** shows all entries under their headings.
- Put `<!-- Spotlight -->` before a change to show it in the short What's new list. Put the most important spotlight changes first in each group.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Before each release, read all of `## Unreleased` again and rewrite each entry that does not obey these rules. Then rename that heading to the version number.

## Unreleased

### New
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Bigger text and posters.** Select **Settings → Picture & Sound → Text and poster size → Large**. Text, posters, buttons and panels get bigger on every screen. Rows show fewer posters, and Home shows the story only on the title page.
- **Play in another app.** Select **Settings → Streams → Video player**, then select a video app on your TV, for example VLC or Just Player. Alder opens that app when you select **Play**. Alder still selects the source, the resume point and the subtitle. When you press Back in the other app, Alder saves where you stopped. If you remove that app, Android asks which app to use.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Anime and other catalogs.** Catalogs of anime, video channels and other types now show. Each type has its own page in the top bar, for example **Anime**. Before, Alder showed only movie, series and live catalogs. Anime with episodes has its episode list, **Next episode** and **Continue**, as a show does. **My List** shows these titles too.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Picture size.** You can make the picture fill the screen. In the player, select **Audio & subtitles → Sync & Style → Picture**. **Fit** shows all of the picture. **Zoom** fills the screen and cuts the edges. **Stretch** fills the screen and changes the shape. Alder keeps your choice for all videos.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Letterboxd ratings.** Alder can show the Letterboxd rating of a film next to the IMDb rating, or in its place. Select **Settings → Profile → Ratings**. Letterboxd ratings need a free MDBList key. Select **MDBList key** and scan the code with your phone, then paste the key on the phone. Shows always use IMDb.
- **Alder website.** The House Lights website shows the TV app, setup steps, and a link to the latest APK.
- Add an Alder website card image with the app screen and product text.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Send report.** When Alder stops, it saves the error on your TV. The next time Home opens, Alder asks to send a report. Select **Send report** or **No**. The report has the error, the Alder version and the TV model. It does not have your account details. To send it later, select **Settings → About → Send report**.

### Easier to use
- **Continue Watching.** The shelf shows the time left and a progress bar below the selected poster.
- **Home.** A short line marks the selected poster. Shelf names are larger. Posters fade at the right edge until you reach the last title.
- The top bar and story text are easier to read over bright art.
- **Change stream keeps your video.** When you select **Change stream**, the video stops and stays behind the source list. Press Back to continue from the same picture without a new load. Select a different source to play it from the same second.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Smooth motion.** Screens fade and settle when they open and close. When you select **Play**, the screen dims to black and the video fades up. A title page opens with its picture moving slowly into place. Focus settles with a small bounce. Panels open fast and close faster. To turn off motion, set the TV to **Remove animations** in its accessibility settings.
- **Gray subtitles.** You can show subtitles in gray. Gray is less bright than white on OLED and Mini LED TVs in a dark room. Select **Settings → Subtitles → Subtitle color → Gray**, or select **Gray** in the player.
- **Subtitle match.** Alder sends the file name and size of the video to subtitle add-ons. The add-on shows subtitles for that release first, so the timing is correct more frequently.
- **Alder website.** The site shows the app screens and makes the download and setup steps easy to find.
- The README has a **Website** badge and a **Downloads** badge with the total number of GitHub release downloads.

### Fixes
- **Home art.** The title and art change together when you stop on a poster. Pictures that are ready fade directly into each other. Alder shows episode numbers when they are available.
- **Resume.** **Continue Watching** and the title page use the same resume point. The title page shows where you stopped.
- **Profile PIN.** Another app cannot open a profile that has a PIN. Alder asks for the PIN first.
- **Sign-in and backups.** Android does not copy profiles, sign-ins and PINs to a new TV.
- **Watch progress.** **My List** and the watched marks do not erase your progress from other devices. Alder gets your Stremio library first, then saves the change.
- **Sound after you leave.** A video does not start again when you go to another app while Alder gets a subtitle or a source. When you come back, the video starts. Before, Alder sometimes went to the next source.
- **Resume point.** Alder goes to the resume point from your other devices also when a subtitle or the file is slow to start.
- **Start again from the beginning.** Left and Right during playback do not start some videos again from the beginning. Before, a change to the subtitle timing in a file that cannot skip ahead started the video at 0:00.
- **Add-on subtitles.** Subtitles from SubDL, OpenSubtitles and other add-ons show correctly. Alder opens zip files and shows letters in all languages correctly, for example Arabic, Polish and Russian. Each subtitle add-on shows its own files in **Audio & subtitles**. Before, files from the first add-on hid the files from other add-ons.
- **Missing sources.** Alder asks every stream add-on that Stremio asks. Before, Alder did not ask some add-ons, and showed no playable sources. Short videos, for example a 7-minute cartoon, show in the source list. Slow debrid add-ons get 45 seconds to answer, not 20.
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **Large files.** Large files, such as 4K remuxes, stop less often to load. On most TVs, Alder now keeps up to 200 MB of the video ready. Before, Alder kept approximately 131 MB, which is only 10 to 17 seconds of a remux. After a stop, Alder waits for 4 seconds of video before it starts again.
- **Long rows.** Alder releases poster memory for titles far off the screen. Rows stay fast when you move through many titles.
- **Rows.** Each row on Shows and Movies keeps its own place. Before, a move to the next row went to the same position as in the last row.
- **Smooth row motion.** Rows move smoothly when you move right fast. Live rows move at the same speed as poster rows. Background art waits until you stop on a title.
- **Missing sources.** The source list tells you which add-ons gave no sources, and why. Before, Alder told you only when no source was available. An add-on that finds only torrents needs a debrid service.
- **Backups.** Alder does not put profiles, sign-ins, or PINs in Android backups or device transfers. After a restore to a new TV, sign in to each profile again.
- **Android 6 and 7.** Alder starts on Android 6 and 7 TVs. Before, Alder closed and the TV showed the home screen.
- **Start after a downgrade.** Alder starts when you install an older version over a newer one. Before, Alder closed at start and the TV showed the home screen.

## 1.3.1

### Fixes
- **Alder.apk download.** The release file uses the Alder.apk name.

### Easier to use
<!-- Spotlight -->
- **House Lights logos.** Alder uses the tungsten mark on the TV banner, transparent app icon, and small transparent logo. The profile picker and Settings headers use vector art.
- **Content ratings on the title page.** A badge shows the content rating, for example PG-13, R, or TV-MA, before the year.

<!-- Spotlight -->

<!-- Spotlight -->

### Fixes
- **Subtitle language list in Audio & subtitles.** All add-on subtitle languages appear under Subtitles. Quick sync sits below the list so remote focus moves smoothly.
- **Up next episode card.** When credit times are available, Alder shows Up next only after the credits start. The fallback starts in the final 15 to 25 seconds.
- **Skip intro button.** Alder reads MKV intro chapters first. Alder filters IntroDB segments with low confidence and stops false prompts at the start of a video.
- **Remote focus and scroll in Audio & subtitles.** When you select a track, remote focus stays on it and the list keeps its position. The list moves smoothly and stays in its panel.
- **Smoked glass overlay in Audio & subtitles.** The Audio & subtitles sheet uses the Alder smoked glass recipe for high contrast over video.
- **Cleaner title page.** The light around **Play** and **Resume** sits in the center. Cast names stay inside the screen margins. Action buttons align in the center.

- **Support older TV devices.** Alder supports Android 6.0 and Fire OS 6 devices, such as Fire TV Stick 4K.
